        "question": "My landlord refuses to return my security deposit",
        "answer": "Your landlord cannot legally withhold your security deposit without valid reasons. Under Bangladeshi rental law, you're entitled to the full return of your deposit when you vacate the property, minus only legitimate deductions for actual damages beyond normal wear and tear. Your landlord must provide written justification and receipts for any deductions. If they refuse to return your deposit or cannot justify the deductions, this constitutes illegal retention of tenant funds and you have legal recourse including filing a General Diary with police and pursuing civil remedies.",

        "question": "I bought a defective product, what are my rights?",
        "answer": "As a consumer, you have strong legal protections against defective products. You have the right to receive goods that match their description, work as promised, and are safe for use. When you purchase a defective product, you're entitled to a replacement, full refund, or compensation for damages. The seller cannot refuse these remedies by claiming 'no returns' or similar policies - such practices violate consumer protection law. You also have the right to accurate information about products before purchase, and protection from misleading advertising or unfair trade practices.",

        "answer": "You have a fundamental legal right to access government information under the Right to Information Act. Any citizen can request information from government offices, and they are legally required to respond within 20 working days. You only need to pay a nominal fee (2 taka per page), and the request can be made in writing or sometimes verbally. The government cannot refuse information unless it falls under specific exemptions like national security or personal privacy. If your request is denied or ignored, you can appeal to the Information Commission at no cost.",

        "question": "Someone cheated me financially, what legal action can I take?",
        "answer": "Financial cheating is a serious criminal offense with severe penalties. If someone has defrauded you through false promises, forged documents, or dishonest schemes, you can pursue both criminal and civil remedies. Criminal charges can result in imprisonment up to 7 years for the perpetrator, while civil action can help you recover your money plus damages. You should preserve all evidence including contracts, receipts, communications, and witness statements. Time is critical - file your complaint promptly as delays can weaken your case and some evidence may be lost.",

        "answer": "Family disputes including divorce, maintenance, child custody, and dower claims are handled by specialized Family Courts established under the Family Courts Ordinance. These courts have exclusive jurisdiction over matrimonial and family matters, providing a more focused and sensitive approach than general civil courts. You can file a suit by submitting a plaint with the required court fee and supporting documents. Family Courts also have provisions for mediation and counseling to help resolve disputes amicably when possible.",

        "answer": "Traffic violations under the Road Transport Act carry specific penalties, and you have rights during the enforcement process. Police must provide you with a proper ticket showing the violation, fine amount, and payment instructions. You have the right to contest unfair or incorrect fines through proper legal channels. Always keep your driving license, vehicle registration, and insurance documents current to avoid penalties. When paying fines, use only official payment methods and keep receipts as proof of payment.",
